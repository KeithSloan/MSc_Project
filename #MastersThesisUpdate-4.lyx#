 was examined looking for relationships between elliptical galaxies characterist
ics, colour, mass and metallicity and their local environments.
 Whilst a direct and obvious relationship was not found, some correlation
 between the characteristics of a galaxy's local group, especially averages
 of environmental measures were noted.
 In addition other aspects of a galaxy's local group were investigated such
 as separation within the local group.
 Looking at environment measures for galaxies in the various types of large
 scale structure, differences were observed especially for those deemed
 to be in a knot structure.
 In a similar way to previous research on a galaxy's satellites, local groups
 with five or more galaxies were investigated looking at galaxy types and
 red fraction and their dependance on environment.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The presiding inference from a large body of research is that the universe
 we see today is initially the result of very small deviations which have
 grown over a very long timescale from the time when the universe was a
 plasma.
 
\color black
We have evidence of the nature of the plasma before the recombination epoch
 in the form of the cosmic background radiation which has today has cooled
 and is a uniform 2.725 Kelvin with variations of only 0.0002K.
 The profile of the radiations wavelength follow a Planck function so well
 that it is stated to be a nearly perfect blackbody.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
We know that dark matter makes up around 27% of the universe and the consensus
 is that an initial primordial field of dark matter has evolved under the
 influence of gravity over a very long time, giving rise to the variations
 in regional density that we see today.
 That a galaxy's local environment is strongly influenced by dark matter
 halo mass, research such as
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-2"
literal "false"

\end_inset

has shown that there is a correlation between galaxy/halo/dark matter and
 the environment.
 Older galaxies are also more strongly clustered in denser environments.
 Data from the Galaxy Redshift Survey
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-3"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-4"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 accord very well with the premiss that large-scale structure formation
 is formed as a result of the cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
Intensive studies of galaxy clusters have demonstrated a clear connection
 between galaxy properties and environment
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 with possible evolution
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 leading to the conclusion that for red early-type galaxies which dominate
 galaxy clusters their properties depend on their environment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
With such a large body of research indicating that the redness of early
 type galaxies is related to their environment then one would expect to
 find obvious and direct relationships between a galaxy's redness and its
 environmental measures.
 The aim was therefore to examine the results of the GAMA survey for the
 relationships between a galaxy's characteristics and its environmental
 measures.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of the GAMA survey is the collection of data from various
 projects to facilitate study of cosmology and galaxy formation.
 It covers approximately 375,000 galaxies with magnitudes down to 19.8 rmag,
 over a 360 degree region of the sky looking at the structure at scales
 of 1kpc to 1Mpc
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The prime sources of the data are

Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The GAMA Survey website suggests that for python usage, the data could be
 accessed using astroquery
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-8"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 but as astroquery does not have facilities for selectively joining and
 manipulating tables, a more flexible approach was to download the GAMA
 data and then process with the python package astropy table
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-9"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 that has facilities to subset and join tables.
 Details of the tables and their contents are available at the GAMA survey
 website
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "key-10"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Python programs were created in Jupyter
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

As can be seen from the plots, there is no obvious relationship between
 the colour (uminusr) of an elliptical galaxy and the four main environmental
 measures.
 The full range of uminusr values extends over the full range of environmental
 measures.
 Pearson and Spearman correlation values are documented in table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "tab:uminusr---Log(Environmnetal"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

 and also show no obvious relationship.
 Pearson and Spearman are standard statistical correlation tests.
 The reason for including a Spearman test was because it gives a better
 measure when dealing with outlying and logarithmic values.
 Similar results were obtained for mass (logmstar)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rational for trying galaxies with logmstar>11 was that research had
 indicated a possible relationship in high density environments.

Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The analysis of the group information was carried out on data downloaded
 for the GAMA website and loaded into astrotables.
 The tables were then processed as follows Table GroupFindings G3CFoFGroup
 contains TotRmag which is computed as the r-band absolute magnitude of
 the group, obtained by adding up the r-band luminosities of its members.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Table GroupFinding - G3CGal contains unique galaxy identifies CATAID and
 which group they are in GroupID, single galaxies having a GroupID of 0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
G3CGal was joined with EnvironmentMeasures to add environmental measures
 information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As local group to galaxy is a one to many relationship joining G3CGAL with
 G3CFFGroup on GroupID results in a table with a unique key of CATAID (
 galaxy identifier ) and group information.
 The group information being repeated for each galaxy in the group.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
as such differences between environmental measures of galaxies with the
 local group will work against the calculation of correlation and be a spread
 in the density plots.

Means for group environmental measures were calculated using the GroupBy
 facility.

\begin_layout Standard

\color black
One would not normally expect a high degree of correlation looking at a
 characteristic of a group versus different characteristics of individual
 members of the group.
 However a degree of correlation was found between group measures and the
 log of environmental measures of the galaxies within the local group.
 The fact that members of the local group have different environmental measures
 means these differences act as a sort of noise signal on any density plot
 or calculated Pearson, Spearman correlation see figures

In order to achieve a one to one correspondence between group characteristic
 and environmental measure a similar exercise was performed on the group
 characteristics versus the means of logs of the environmental measures

.
 The use of means being a different way of handling the differences within
 the local group.
 Given the differences between galaxies with a local group one would not
 expect to see values as high as 0.8 - 0.9 but the observed correlation values
 of 0.6 - 0.7 show there is some correlation.
 The most likely explanation as to why such correlations do not show up
 with the analysis of individual galaxies, is that there are a wide range
 of values for individual galaxies and it is only when you subset them on
 a group basis that some correlation is observed.
 The group characteristics being influenced by the density within the universe
 which is also effecting the individual environmental measures.

When looking at the positional information, it is important to remember
 that galaxies are three dimensional whereas the data is represented in
 two dimensions, the y axis being the measure uminusr or logmstar and the
 x axis the distance from the centre of the local group.
 There are a number of ways of defining the center of a group.
 The most common measure quoted in astrophysics literature is CoSepBCG.

 The number of eigenvalues above an imposed threshold indicates the number
 of collapsed dimensions of structure at that location - either 0, 1, 2
 or 3, corresponding to a void, sheet, filament or knot, respectively.
 The classification of the grid, as given in the GeometricGrid table, allows
 the geometric environment of any object within the grid (any object in
 the G09, G12 or G15 regions with 0.04 < z < 0.263) to be determined by assigning
 the object the same environment as the cell of the grid in which the object

Lots of processes in astrophysics happen on large time scales, often many
 orders of magnitude longer than a human lifetime or the timescale of our
 scientific knowledge.
 For a lot of processes we are not able to make measurements on timescales
 that would provide meaningful results.
 However, as there are billions of stars in our own galaxy and billions
 of galaxies, we can use the fact that we can observe a very large number
 of stars and galaxies to draw conclusions.
 The use of distributions is an attempt to gain insights by looking at the
 properties of various distributions.
 Distributions at different redshifts would prove useful but given the timescale
s for galaxy evolution, a differences in redshift of z=0.5 is generally required
 and this is not available with the GAMA data due to the flux limited nature
 of the collected data.

It would not be surprising that the distribution of galaxies turn out to
 be lognormal distributions.
 Now in the distant past,the things that initially effect galaxy distribution
 were probably distributed normally.
 We know from detailed measurements of the cosmic background that at the
 time of recombination, matter in the universe was very uniformly distributed.
 At the much later time for initial star formation from clouds of gas, it
 is standard procedure to assume normal distributions when modelling of
 the early stages of galaxy evolution

 It is not unreasonable to assume that gaseous matter and or primordial
 dark matter that predates and leads to galaxy evolution is highly random
 and hence has a normal/Gaussian distribution.

So taking a variable of x with a normal distribution PDF f(x) which describes

 which describes the number of log normal distributed galaxy's, the relationship
 between the two PDFs would conform to the following differential equation

Two sides of the equation equate when

Observations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
In the case of redness uminusr, the distribution fitted curve to equation
 2 matches the histogram quite well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
For logmstar, the distribution looks quite normal/Gaussian
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Is it wishful thinking that for logmstar the value for a is 2.78 which rounded
 up to a whole number is 3 and that the mass of a galaxy is related to volume
 of gas?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize

\color black
In reality given the complexity of galaxy evolution as described in 8.3,
 the transform function and its inverse are highly likely to be quite complex
 functions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Further work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Take into account error estimation and confidence ranges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
With advice from theorists on galaxy evolution are there more promising
 transfer and inverse functions?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The newly launched James Webb Telescope should be able to observe light
 from the time of star and galaxy formation and hence supply suitable distributi
on informatio.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The GAMA survey is limited

due to the flux limited nature of the collected data.
 Future surveys will hopefully allow the change of distribution for different

Overall Conclusions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Just to remined ourselves, 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Redness as measured by uminusr is given the nature of star and galaxy evolution
 a measure of age.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
That elliptical galaxies have evolved from and have a greater age than spiral
 galaxies and therefore redder (have a larger measure of uminusr).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The various environmental measures a measure of the density of the local
 universe.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Looking at the complete set of elliptical galaxies in the GAMA dataset there
 does not appear to be a direct correlation between galaxy characteristics
 and environmental measures.
 There is sufficient variation in uminusr and the environmental measures
 that any correlation between the two is not obviously revealed.
 Even just looking at the set of galaxies with large logmass no obvious
 relationship is revealed.
 If one looks at subsets of galaxies within a local group then one does
 see some degree of correlation 0.5-0.6 between the groups redness TotRMag
 and mass as in sum of logmstar and the means of environmental measures
 of the galaxies within its local group.
 Now the environmental measures of a galaxy in a local group is strongly
 influenced by the local group as they are a measure of the local density,
 for example DistanceTo5nn is a measure of the distance to the five nearest
 neighbours.
 Where a local group is in a dense part of the universe the environmental
 measures of galaxies within the group will exhibit more dense environment
 measures, singularly and as a group.
 Likewise if the local group is in a less dense part of the universe the
 galaxy environmental measures will reflect this.
 Galaxies within a local group are likely to have formed at similar times.
 Environmental measures vary significantly with large scale structure.
 That studying of distributions has some promise and may prove fruitful
 as advances in telescopes allow us to look at distributions from earlier
 times and over larger values of redshift.
